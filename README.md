## 📘 PROJECT OVERVIEW

THIS REPOSITORY SERVES AS A DEEP DIVE INTO THE MECHANICS OF REGRESSION ANALYSIS. INSTEAD OF RELYING ON `model.fit()`, THIS PROJECT MANUALLY IMPLEMENTS THE OPTIMIZATION LOOPS, COST FUNCTION CALCULATIONS, AND PARAMETER UPDATES. IT IS DESIGNED TO DEMONSTRATE THE MATHEMATICAL FIDELITY OF CUSTOM IMPLEMENTATIONS BY BENCHMARKING THEM AGAINST INDUSTRY-STANDARD LIBRARIES.

---

## 💬 FEATURES

- **ZERO ML LIBRARIES:** BUILT STRICTLY WITH `NUMPY`, `PANDAS`, AND `MATPLOTLIB`.
- **MULTIPLE OPTIMIZERS:** INCLUDES BATCH, STOCHASTIC (SGD), AND MINI-BATCH GRADIENT DESCENT.
- **ANALYTICAL SOLUTION:** IMPLEMENTATION OF THE **NORMAL EQUATION** FOR EXACT SOLUTIONS.
- **ADVANCED ANALYSIS:** LEARNING RATE DECAY, CONVERGENCE MONITORING, ETC.
- **BENCHMARKING:** COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AGAINST `SCIKIT-LEARN` TO VERIFY ACCURACY.

---

## 📁 NOTEBOOKS BREAKDOWN

### `ROOT DIRECTORY`

- **LinearRegression_GradientDescent.ipynb** – THE CORE IMPLEMENTATION COVERING BATCH, STOCHASTIC, AND MINI-BATCH GRADIENT DESCENT ALGORITHMS ALONG WITH LEARNING RATE DECAY ANALYSIS AND EXTENSIVE VISUALIZATIONS.
- **LinearRegression_NormalEquation.ipynb** – THE ANALYTICAL APPROACH USING MATRIX OPERATIONS (LINEAR ALGEBRA) TO SOLVE FOR PARAMETERS DIRECTLY WITHOUT ITERATION.
- **DATA/** – CONTAINS THE INPUT DATASETS `linearX.csv` AND `linearY.csv`.

---

## 🧠 MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. THE HYPOTHESIS
$$h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$$

### 2. COST FUNCTION (MSE)
$$J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$$

### 3. GRADIENT DESCENT UPDATE RULE
$$\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$$

### 4. NORMAL EQUATION
$$\theta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y$$

## 📊 METHODS IMPLEMENTED

### 🔁 OPTIMIZATION-BASED METHODS
- BATCH GRADIENT DESCENT  
- STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT (SGD)  
- MINI-BATCH GRADIENT DESCENT  
- LEARNING RATE DECAY FOR SGD  

### 📐 ANALYTICAL METHOD
- NORMAL EQUATION  
- PSEUDO-INVERSE FOR NUMERICAL STABILITY  

### 📏 EVALUATION METRICS (FROM SCRATCH)
- MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR (MAE)  
- MEAN SQUARED ERROR (MSE)  
- ROOT MEAN SQUARED ERROR (RMSE)  
- R² SCORE (COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION)  

---

## 📊 VISUALIZATION HIGHLIGHTS

- **CONVERGENCE GRAPHS:** PLOTS COST FUNCTION VS. ITERATIONS TO VISUALIZE OPTIMIZATION SPEED.
- **SGD NOISE ANALYSIS:** COMPARES THE STABLE PATH OF BATCH GD AGAINST THE NOISY PATH OF STOCHASTIC GD.
- **LEARNING RATE DECAY:** DEMONSTRATES HOW DECAYING LR STABILIZES SGD OSCILLATIONS NEAR THE MINIMUM.
- **REGRESSION FITS:** OVERLAYS THE LEARNED REGRESSION LINE ON RAW DATA POINTS.

## ⚙️ HOW IT WORKS

1.  **DATA LOADING:** READS RAW CSV DATA AND PERFORMS Z-SCORE NORMALIZATION.
2.  **MODEL INITIALIZATION:** SETS HYPERPARAMETERS (LEARNING RATE, EPOCHS, BATCH SIZE).
3.  **OPTIMIZATION:**
    * **GRADIENT DESCENT:** ITERATIVELY UPDATES WEIGHTS TO MINIMIZE ERROR.
    * **NORMAL EQUATION:** SOLVES FOR WEIGHTS DIRECTLY USING LINEAR ALGEBRA.
4.  **EVALUATION:** CALCULATES $R^2$ SCORE, MAE, MSE, AND RMSE MANUALLY.
5.  **VISUALIZATION:** PLOTS COST HISTORY, REGRESSION FIT, AND ANIMATIONS.
   
---

## 🏁 USAGE

1.  **SELECT THE NOTEBOOK:** CHOOSE BETWEEN ITERATIVE (GD) OR ANALYTICAL (NORMAL EQ) METHODS.
2.  **RUN THE CELLS:** EXECUTE PREPROCESSING AND TRAINING STEPS.
3.  **EXPERIMENT:** MODIFY `learning_rate` OR `batch_size` IN THE CLASS INSTANTIATION TO SEE DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS.

## 📈 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

<div style="text-align: justify;">
THE CUSTOM IMPLEMENTATIONS ACHIEVED NEAR-IDENTICAL RESULTS TO SCIKIT-LEARN, VALIDATING THE MATHEMATICAL CORRECTNESS OF THE ALGORITHMS.

- **BATCH GD** MATCHED SCIKIT-LEARN PREDICTIONS WITH A DIFFERENCE OF APPROXIMATELY **0.00048**.
- **NORMAL EQUATION** DERIVED THE EXACT ANALYTICAL OPTIMUM.
- **SGD WITH DECAY** SUCCESSFULLY CONVERGED DEEPER THAN FIXED LR SGD.

THE PROJECT DEMONSTRATES THAT BUILDING ALGORITHMS FROM SCRATCH IS THE BEST WAY TO DEMYSTIFY MACHINE LEARNING BLACK BOXES.
</div>

### ✔ KEY OBSERVATIONS
- REGRESSION LINES FROM SCRATCH AND SCIKIT-LEARN OVERLAP CLOSELY  
- NORMAL EQUATION MATCHES SCIKIT-LEARN EXACTLY  
- GRADIENT DESCENT CONVERGES TO THE SAME SOLUTION SPACE  
- LEARNING RATE STRONGLY INFLUENCES CONVERGENCE SPEED AND STABILITY

## 🚀 FUTURE WORK

- ADD SUPPORT FOR **MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION** (MULTIVARIATE).
- IMPLEMENT **POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION** FROM SCRATCH.
- ADD **L1 (LASSO) AND L2 (RIDGE) REGULARIZATION**.
- CREATE A WEB INTERFACE FOR UPLOADING DATASETS AND VISUALIZING RESULTS.
